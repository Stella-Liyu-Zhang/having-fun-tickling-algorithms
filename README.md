base bonus, bonus is equal to base bonus plus K, where K is the number of levels between the new worker and the worker's referrer

Consider a referral chain A -> B -> C -> D

- If that worker (C) refers worker (D), then worker (C) receives (D)'s full bonus, worker (B) receives (D);s bonus plus 1, and worker (A) receives (D);s bonus plus 2

- sort by their total bonus amount from largest to smallest.
- If same total bonus amount, then the worker's names shall appear in lexicographical rder.
