## System Design

- Popular Resources:

  - Grokking the System Design Interview: paid text-based course, ~20 hrs. I think it’s overkill for new grads, but doesn’t hurt to be over-prepared if you have time
  - System Design Primer: a shorter but detailed guide
  - System Design Cheatsheet: a good checklist for those who already have some background

- Most new-grad “system design” interviews ask about product design and/or objected oriented design, where the objective is fairly straightforward and limited in scope. The interviewers rarely dig deep into scalability or database concepts, etc. However, you should still have a basic understanding of:
  - Load balancing
  - Caching
  - Multi-threading and concurrency issues
  - Networking
  - Vertical and horizontal scaling
  - Database replication and partitioning
  - Asynchrony and queues
