## Technical Conversations

### Deep dive on a project you worked on: discuss architecture, design decisions, challenges, and impact

### - For language-specific roles, be able to answer language trivia

### - For systems-oriented roles, brush up on OS and networking basics

## Coding Interviews

- Clarify expectations beforehand
  - “Will I need to compile and run the code, or is pseudocode sufficient?”
- Be verbose, explain your thought process, and ask for feedback - “Should I go ahead with this approach?”
  Work incrementally
- If there are steps or optimizations that aren’t essential parts of your algorithm, ask your interviewer if they are fine with you writing a stub and coming back to it later (time permitting).
- Similarly, don’t focus on edge cases until you’ve sketched the core algorithm.
- Use descriptive variable names
