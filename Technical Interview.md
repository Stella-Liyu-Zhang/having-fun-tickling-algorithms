## Technical Conversations

### Deep dive on a project you worked on: discuss architecture, design decisions, challenges, and impact

### - For language-specific roles, be able to answer language trivia

### - For systems-oriented roles, brush up on OS and networking basics

## Coding Interviews

- Clarify expectations beforehand
  - “Will I need to compile and run the code, or is pseudocode sufficient?”
- Be verbose, explain your thought process, and ask for feedback - “Should I go ahead with this approach?”
  Work incrementally
- If there are steps or optimizations that aren’t essential parts of your algorithm, ask your interviewer if they are fine with you writing a stub and coming back to it later (time permitting).
- Similarly, don’t focus on edge cases until you’ve sketched the core algorithm.
- Use descriptive variable names

## What is the difference between relational and non-relational databases?

> There are many differences between relational and non-relational databases, but I find that one of the biggest differences is how they store data. Relational databases use tables to organize data into rows and columns, while non-relational databases do not use this method. Instead, non-relational databases use documents to store data.”

## How would you approach analyzing unstructured text data?

> Example: “I would first determine what I’m looking for within the data, whether it be keywords or phrases that are important to the company.
> Then, I’d create a list of all possible words and phrases that could be relevant to my search.
> Next, I’d run each word through a language analyzer to see if it’s relevant to the project. Finally, I’d sort the results by relevance and review them to find any patterns.

## API

Similarly, an API lists a bunch of operations that developers can use, along with a description of what they do. The developer doesn’t necessarily need to know how, for example, an operating system builds and presents a “Save As” dialog box. They just need to know that it’s available for use in their app.
