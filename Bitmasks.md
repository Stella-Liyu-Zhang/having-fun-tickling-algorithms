Bitmasking is a technique used to perform operations at the bit level.
Leveraging bitmasks often leads to faster runtime complexity and helps limit memory usage

```md
Test kth bit : s &(1 << k);
Set kth bit : s |= (1 << k);
Turn off kth bit : s &= ~(1 << k);
Toggle kth bit : s ^= (1 << k);
Multiple by 2n : s << n;
Divide by 2n : s >> n;
Intersection : s &t;
Union : s | t;
Set Subtraction : s & ~t;
Extract lowest set bit : s & (-s);
Extract lowest unset bit : ~s &(s + 1);
Swap Values : x ^= y;
y ^= x;
x ^= y;
```
