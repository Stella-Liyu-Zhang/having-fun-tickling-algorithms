# Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree is a special form of a binary tree. The value in each node must be greater than (or equal to) any values in its left subtree but less than (or equal to) any values in its right subtree.

## Definition of a BST

A binary search tree (BST), a special form of a binary tree, satisfies the binary search property:

1. The value in each node must be greater than (or equal to) any values stored in its left subtree.
2. The value in each node must be less than (or equal to) any values stored in its right subtree.

Like a normal binary tree, we can traverse a BST in preorder, inorder, postorder or level-order. However, it is noteworthy that inorder traversal in BST will be in ascending order. Therefore, the inorder traversal is the most frequent used traversal method of a BST.
